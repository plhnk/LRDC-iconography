<h1>Guidelines for Icons on Liferay.com</h1>
<p>For maximum success, we have developed a set of 'nice-to-haves' and a set of 'must-haves' for icons on Liferay.com</p>
<ol>Must Have
  <li>Stroke weight of 1.5px (Yes, we know there isn't such thing as .5 of a pixel, but 1px is too light, and 2px is too heavy, so Goldilocks picked 1.5)</li>
  <li>Sit nicely in our standard sizes of 200x120, 60x60, or 36x36</li>
  <li>No fill</li>
  <li>Fit stylistically with the others (conformity is freedom!)</li>
</ol>

<ul>Nice to Have
  <li>Stroke color of #1C75B9</li>
  <li>Multiple sizes (i.e. can be scaled to any of the three sizes effectively)</li>
